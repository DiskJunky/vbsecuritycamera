Visual Basic Security Camera

This project and set of common modules contains a sample Visual Basic 6.0 security camera with primative motion detection. It's primary purpose was to demonstrate a set of common reusable components for a programmer to interact with the OS easily using Visual Basic 6.0.

Useful components;
* A system tray icon that can reload automaticall if explorer.exe restarts. Also raises the appropriate mouse events.
* A module for reading/writing registry entries
* A module containing common string functions (padd, wrap, count, etc. in various flavours now common in OO languages)
* A class for dealing with in memory bitmaps. Contains quite a few functions that extend Paint functionality including masked blends, drawing gradients, polygons, etc.
* A class for encoding bitmaps as JPEG images using just Visual Basic code (no external dependencies). Copyright ©2003 Ron van Tilburg, adapted/Modified/Restructured from cJPEG (©2003 John Korejwa) by Ron van Tilburg 29 Nov 2003
